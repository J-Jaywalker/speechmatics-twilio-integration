Feature: AsyncQueueSource

    Speechmatics' AsyncMultiChannelClient reads round-robin from every
    audio source it's handed. If any source ever returns empty bytes it
    interprets that as EOF and tears down the *whole* session - so a
    naive queue-backed source would break the moment Twilio has a
    momentary lull in packets.

    AsyncQueueSource is the adapter that solves this. It behaves like a
    file:
      - read(n) blocks until at least some data is available (never
        returns short unless we're closing).
      - close() posts an EOF sentinel so pending reads unblock and
        subsequent reads keep returning empty bytes.
      - Late enqueue() calls after close() are silently dropped so
        Twilio's tail-end frames can't accidentally revive a source.

    These tests pin down that contract so future refactors don't
    regress the "keep the session alive during a phone call" property.
