Feature: TwiML builder (_build_twiml)

    When a call comes in, Twilio fetches HTTP GET on our /twiml
    endpoint and executes whatever TwiML we return. The response has
    to contain exactly the right elements in the right shape:

      <Response>
        <Start>
          <Stream track="both_tracks" url="wss://.../twilio" />
        </Start>
        <Say>...</Say>
        <Dial>+E164</Dial>
      </Response>

    A single wrong attribute (e.g. `track="inbound"` instead of
    `"both_tracks"`) and Twilio silently plays "an application error
    has occurred" without any obvious clue why. These tests pin the
    shape so refactors can't sneak a regression in.

        callee audio into two separate channels; anything else (e.g.

    Purpose:

            TwiML. Silent connect => you know something's wrong.
