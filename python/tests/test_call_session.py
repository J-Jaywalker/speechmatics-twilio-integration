Feature: CallSession routing + audio wire-format invariants

    A CallSession owns one Speechmatics multi-channel session covering
    both Twilio tracks. Two things must hold for the demo to work:

      1. Audio wire format: we forward Twilio's native mulaw / 8 kHz
         frames straight through, no transcoding. If any of those
         constants drift the pipeline breaks silently.

      2. Track routing: each Twilio 'media' event carries a `track`
         label ("inbound" or "outbound"); frames must land in the
         AsyncQueueSource that matches that label so the multi-channel
         SDK can produce per-speaker transcripts.

    These tests don't spin up a real Speechmatics session - they only
    exercise the pieces that live inside CallSession itself.

    Purpose:
        Guards the "no transcoding" property. Twilio Media Streams
        emits mulaw 8 kHz in 20 ms (160-byte) frames; Speechmatics RT
        accepts that natively. If any of these three values drift,

        Twilio's Media Streams `media.track` field is always the bare

        Speechmatics channel labels means routing is a simple dict
        lookup - no translation table to maintain, no accidental
