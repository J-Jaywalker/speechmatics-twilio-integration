Feature: handle_twilio_call - Twilio Media Streams event loop

    handle_twilio_call is the WebSocket handler Twilio talks to for the
    lifetime of one phone call. It:

      - Receives JSON events over the socket ("connected", "start",
        "media", "stop").
      - Creates a CallSession on "start" (which spins up the
        Speechmatics RT connection).
      - Base64-decodes each "media" payload and routes it to the
        session by track label.
      - Closes the session cleanly when the call ends, whether that's
        a graceful "stop" event or an abrupt connection drop.

    The tests below feed canned event streams through a fake WebSocket
    (see conftest.fake_ws) and assert on the interaction with
    CallSession. CallSession itself is patched to an AsyncMock so the
    real Speechmatics client is never contacted - these are pure logic
    tests for the event router.
